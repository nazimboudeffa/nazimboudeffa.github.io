# ðŸ‘‰ What's next ?

I don't know maybe to write a book or to fork and PR, what do you think ? In fact I have found an excellent entry on how does Reg Braithwaite write a books on [his blog](http://braythwayt.com/2015/01/29/how-i-write-books-with-github-and-leanpub.html) which motivated me to open an issue on his AMA - my Ask Me Anything is simply my github.io repo and feel free to open an issue - so I am moving on writing [a translation of Javascript AllongÃ©](https://leanpub.com/javascript-rallonge) first then parallelly writing a book in [FR] and [EN] in the same time about the experience I've got this last years working on Phaser and particularly the Community Edition version


# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Microsoft

The Octocat is out of the bag: GitHub is beeing bought by Microsoft (M$) and I don't know what I will become when the deal closes later this year. Iâ€™m confident that this change will be great for GitHub and developers around the world, and I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce myself.

Who am I? My name is Nazim and Iâ€™ve been a developer since I was young. Iâ€™ve been active in open source since the 90s when I discovered Linux.

I was blown away to discover a free operating system that came with an editor, compiler, and debugger---all of the tools you need to be a developer, and all of the source code! It was an incredible opportunity for a student in a middle town in Britany to learn from the best developers in the world. I spent many years working with Linux and founded a couple of open source companies. My first commit to GitHub was in 2010, when GitHub was two years old.

Today I live near Lyon and I am not yet a father. seven years ago I joined GitHub before it was bought by M$, a developer-focused site I started with Phaser and Atom. I was delighted to see that GitHub was broadening its horizons as a developer-centric site by leting coders develop  technologies like Linux, Git, node, and Metasploit, while Microsoft had become a massive contributor to open source, and was remodeling its engineering culture after the example of open source projects.

I believe GitHub will be the ideal opensource platteform for Microsoft, and as a developer who loves GitHub, leading its next chapter will be an incredibly exciting opportunity and responsibility to the new CEO. Just as open source helped launch my career, millions of people today depend on GitHub to help them learn, grow, and build amazing things. I'm determined to take that opportunity to millions more around the world.

At the same time, I've seen that there is some healthy skepticism in the community, so I want to know if it will be absolutely clear about two things:

* **GitHub will operate independently as a community, platform, and business.** This means that GitHub will retain its developer-first values, distinctive spirit, and open extensibility. We will always support developers in their choice of any language, license, tool, platform, or cloud.

* **GitHub will retain its product philosophy.** We love GitHub because of the deep care and thoughtfulness that goes into every facet of the developerâ€™s experience. I understand and respect this, and know that we will continue to build tasteful, snappy, polished tools that developers love.

Iâ€™m trusting the new CEO, and I think that the GitHub community is committed to earning it. I canâ€™t wait to see how M$ will make the GitHub platform and community thatâ€™s special to all of us even greater.

PS: Iâ€™ll be doing some cleaning to my accounts in the next few days, I hope to see M$ following!
