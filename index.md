# üò´ I am tired

STOP! I am going to write a bit on livejournal to explain why I can't continue my eutrepreneurship and take some distance after 5 years of hard work

# üò∑ Working from Home but What TODO ?

It's the end of the quaranteen and I need a haircut, I have passed the last days at home reading mags and watching movies, nothing has changed before, while and after, now that people are working from home too, how can I find a job to let me live from my daily coding routine

I've opened a Discord server and reorganised an old Slack one with some bot in the sens of working from home, while sending some invites on Discord to discuss code (as the major part of the communities are gamers) it seems that the communities have made some rules in this sens that I haven't know before, so I need to put the invit link somewhere to let my Discord server staying public and keep my Slack one private in the sens of GitHub has let organisations have illimited private repos and I have to find a way of making money with opensource

‚òï The Discord server is left public [Let's Code Better Together](https://discord.gg/EpZTKMb) 

üç∞ The Slack one will stay private and a 30 days invit is sent when you [TIP ME](https://fr.tipeee.com/nazimboudeffa) to unlock the link

# üëé Things are not Simple

While it's the end of the world with the Covid-19 I have stopped my contribution to PhaserJS Community Edition because of no cash to continue [answering questions for free](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:2107253+[phaser-framework]), the only solution is to go back to the previous post and finish the Phaser Cookbook before going ahead also my web sites are still without any ads from Google Ads or whatever the anouncer, while my ad server is working but nobody asked me to promote something.

Now I pass the major part of my time updating a new project with [METATRADER](https://trello.com/b/YNVaqAtS/metatrader) to make some money and continue to keep the technologies up and running and playing the rest of the time on [GeForceNow](https://trello.com/b/EBT5dqv1/geforcenow) searching for the best games to buy instead of buying anything and seeing it retired from the GFN list of games because they can't make an agreement with NVidia so they are trying to sell to us our games a second time like on Google Stadia which is weired, or it mean that am in the wrong understanding of why when I buy a game on steam I can't play it on a cloud service because I don't have a big 2000$ config. 

So, my previous post was not able to make things more suitable for me or motivates me to continue to develop cool stuff on GitHub and the problem is that I don't have the money to live in this way.

The only solution I have actually is :

1. Make some cash on [eToro](https://www.etoro.com/people/nazimboudeffa) that can pay OVH hosting and the domain names
2. Make the existing Ubuntu LAMP sites always available and develop them
3. Work on a server with NGINX/HHVM/NODE
4. Become a founder member of GFN and have fun with the BIG GAMES on Mixer

# üëâ What's Next ?

I don't know maybe to write a book or to fork and PR, what do you think ? In fact I have found an excellent entry on how does Reg Braithwaite write books on [his blog](http://braythwayt.com/2015/01/29/how-i-write-books-with-github-and-leanpub.html) which motivated me to open an issue on his AMA - my Ask Me Anything is simply my github.io repo and feel free to open an issue - so I am moving on writing [a translation of Javascript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascript-rallonge) first then parallelly writing a book in [FR] and [EN] in the same time about the experience I've got this last years working on Phaser and particularly the Community Edition version, why not starting to PR officially ? I mean not just discussing the code by opening an issue, no seriously a real PR that engages myself in some official big projects of big companies here on GitHub.

My actual decision (still on this post) is to start to work on some translations of the community books that allows translations in french starting by YDKJS and Javascript Allong√© of course (see my few notes http://bit.ly/2Gm8Xib). The french opensource community is not really active in my opinion, may be [Open Food Facts](https://openfoodfacts.org) where I code in JS and Prestashop which is an awesome place to make money with [dropshipping](https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/prestaliexpress) maybe, am not sure that there are some pointers on people that are the references in JS for instance. So, why not becomming this reference that is needed in french cons ? Starting with JQuery then playing with PhaserJS to land on React, it should not be so hard.


# üëã Hello, Microsoft

The Octocat is out of the bag: GitHub is beeing bought by Microsoft (M$) and I don't know what I will become when the deal closes later this year. I‚Äôm confident that this change will be great for GitHub and developers around the world, and I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce myself.

Who am I? My name is Nazim and I‚Äôve been a developer since I was young. I‚Äôve been active in open source since the 90s when I discovered Linux.

I was blown away to discover a free operating system that came with an editor, compiler, and debugger---all of the tools you need to be a developer, and all of the source code! It was an incredible opportunity for a student in a middle town in Britany to learn from the best developers in the world. I spent many years working with Linux and founded a couple of open source companies. My first commit to GitHub was in 2010, when GitHub was two years old.

Today I live near Lyon and I am not yet a father. seven years ago I joined GitHub before it was bought by M$, a developer-focused site I started with Phaser and Atom. I was delighted to see that GitHub was broadening its horizons as a developer-centric site by leting coders develop  technologies like Linux, Git, node, and Metasploit, while Microsoft had become a massive contributor to open source, and was remodeling its engineering culture after the example of open source projects.

I believe GitHub will be the ideal opensource platteform for Microsoft, and as a developer who loves GitHub, leading its next chapter will be an incredibly exciting opportunity and responsibility to the new CEO. Just as open source helped launch my career, millions of people today depend on GitHub to help them learn, grow, and build amazing things. I'm determined to take that opportunity to millions more around the world.

At the same time, I've seen that there is some healthy skepticism in the community, so I want to know if it will be absolutely clear about two things:

* **GitHub will operate independently as a community, platform, and business.** This means that GitHub will retain its developer-first values, distinctive spirit, and open extensibility. We will always support developers in their choice of any language, license, tool, platform, or cloud.

* **GitHub will retain its product philosophy.** We love GitHub because of the deep care and thoughtfulness that goes into every facet of the developer‚Äôs experience. I understand and respect this, and know that we will continue to build tasteful, snappy, polished tools that developers love.

I‚Äôm trusting the new CEO, and I think that the GitHub community is committed to earning it. I can‚Äôt wait to see how M$ will make the GitHub platform and community that‚Äôs special to all of us even greater.

PS: I‚Äôll be doing some cleaning to my accounts in the next few days, I hope to see M$ following!
